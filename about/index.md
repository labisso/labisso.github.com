About
-----

I'm David LaBissoniere, developer for the
[Nimbus Project](http://www.nimbusproject.org) based at the University of
Chicago and nearby Argonne National Laboratory. My job is to build, maintain,
and contribute to lots of open source software. It's nearly all in the realm
of cloud computing for the scientific world.

I live in Chicago with my wife [Emily](http://baconandorca.blogspot.com)
although lately we've been making a habit of my team's flexible work policy.
This year we spent three months in the Netherlands while I worked remotely.
We want to do it again once we figure out where to go.
