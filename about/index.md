About
-----

I'm David LaBissoniere, backend developer for
[Dell Cloud Manager](http://www.enstratius.com) (formerly Enstratius). I'm
proud to work with a great team of people.

I've contributed to a number of open source projects. For a few years I worked
at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory where my role was
to build open source software in support of computational science, under the
[Nimbus Project](http://www.nimbusproject.org). I founded or contributed to a
number of projects there including
[Nimbus IaaS](https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus),
[dashi](https://github.com/nimbusproject/dashi), and
[kazoo](https://github.com/python-zk/kazoo). At Dell I've managed to keep the
open source spirit alive by helping build and release
[Blockade](https://github.com/dcm-oss/blockade), a Docker-based network failure
testing tool.

I live in Chicago with my wife [Emily](http://www.theleagueofwhimsy.com)
although in the past few years I've taken advantage of flexible work policies
and periodically worked remotely from the Netherlands, Scotland, and Costa Rica
-- so far.
